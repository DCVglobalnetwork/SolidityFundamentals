# Solidity Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of basic smart contracts written in Solidity to cover fundamental concepts. Each contract demonstrates a different aspect of Solidity.

## Contracts

1. `BasicContract.sol` - Basic contract structure.
2. `StateVariables.sol` - State variables.
3. `Functions.sol` - Functions.
4. `Modifiers.sol` - Modifiers.
5. `Events.sol` - Events.
6. `Mappings.sol` - Mappings.
7. `Structs.sol` - Structs.
8. `Arrays.sol` - Arrays.
9. `Inheritance.sol` - Inheritance.
10. `Libraries.sol` - Libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DCVglobalnetwork/SolidityFundamentals.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

```sh
cd SolidityFundamentals
```
3. Install Dependencies
This project does not have any specific dependencies. However,
you will need Node.js and Truffle (or Hardhat) to compile, test, and deploy the smart contracts.

|  Truffle      |   Hardhat     |
| ------------- | ------------- |

You can install Truffle globally using npm:
```sh
npm install -g truffle
```

Or, if you prefer Hardhat, you can install it globally as well:

```sh
npm install -g hardhat
```
4. Compile the Contracts
*To compile the smart contracts, you need to use Truffle or Hardhat*

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ``` truffle compile``` | to compile the smart contracts  |
| ```npx hardhat compile```| to compile the smart contracts |

5. Test the Contracts
Run the test suite to ensure that all contracts work as expected.

## To compile and deploy these contracts, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

Follow the instructions in the respective frameworks to set up your development environment.

6. Interact with the Contracts
You can interact with the deployed contracts using a variety of tools, including:

+ Remix IDE: An online IDE for Solidity development.
+ Ethers.js or Web3.js: JavaScript libraries for interacting with Ethereum.
+ Ganache: A local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.
