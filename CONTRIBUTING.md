## Contributing to Solidity Fundamentals
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Solidity Fundamentals project! 
Whether you want to improve the codebase, add new features, or help with documentation, your contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Getting Started
**1. Setting Up Your Development Environment**
To get started with Solidity development, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solidity-fundamentals.git
cd solidity-fundamentals
```
Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary tools and dependencies for Solidity development:

Install Node.js (which includes npm) from Node.js official site.
Install Hardhat (or Truffle) for Solidity development:
```sh
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
Initialize the Hardhat Project:
If not already initialized, you can set up Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat
```
Follow the prompts to create a new Hardhat project.

Install Other Required Packages:
```sh
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```
Run the Development Environment:
To compile contracts and run local tests, use:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```
**2. Submitting Code Changes**
To submit code changes, follow these steps:

Create a New Branch:
```sh
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
Make Your Changes:
Implement your changes in the Solidity contracts or related files.

Test Your Changes:
Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality by running:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
Commit Your Changes:
Use meaningful commit messages to describe your changes:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature to smart contract"
```
Push Your Changes:
```sh
git push origin your-branch-name
```
Create a Pull Request:
Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub from your branch to the main branch. Provide a clear description of your changes, including any relevant details or context.

**3. Writing Tests**
Testing is crucial to ensure that your Solidity code works as intended:

Write Unit Tests:
Write tests for your smart contracts using Hardhat or Truffle. For example, using Hardhat and Chai:

javascript
```sh
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("MyContract", function () {
  it("Should return the correct number", async function () {
    const MyContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyContract");
    const myContract = await MyContract.deploy(5);
    await myContract.deployed();

    expect(await myContract.getNumber()).to.equal(5);
  });
});
```
Run Tests:
Execute the tests to verify that everything works:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
**4. Reviewing and Approving Pull Requests**
When reviewing pull requests:

Review Code for Quality:
Ensure the code follows project standards, is well-written, and does not introduce bugs.

Run Tests:
Verify that all tests pass with the new changes:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
Provide Feedback:
If necessary, request changes or provide constructive feedback.

Merge the Pull Request:
After approval, merge the PR into the main branch.

**5. Adhering to Coding Standards and Best Practices**
To maintain high-quality code:

Follow Solidity Style Guide:
Adhere to best practices for Solidity development, such as those outlined in Solidity Style Guide.

Document Your Code:
Use comments and NatSpec annotations to document your smart contracts and functions:
```sh
/**
 * @dev Sets the number.
 * @param _number The number to set.
 */
function setNumber(uint _number) public {
    myNumber = _number;
}
```
Optimize Gas Usage:
Write efficient smart contracts to minimize gas costs.

Handle Edge Cases:
Ensure your contracts handle edge cases and unexpected inputs gracefully.

Respect Existing Architecture:
Follow the project's architecture and design patterns.
